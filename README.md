# Make a Line - A Color Lines Clone/Remake
Back in 2005 I did my own version of the addictive puzzle game "Color Lines". 
Now I recovered this old source code and decided to release it under MIT License. 
Maybe it is still of use for someone.

In 2005 I wrote this game in MS Visual C++ 6.0 using the DirectX 6 SDK. Therefore some modifications will be necessary to compile it under a modern environment. The original Visual Studio project files are included.
I used the A* Pathfinder (Version 1.71a) by Patrick Lester for this game.

Note: All texts in actual game are in German but gameplay should be easily understandable. All comments in the source code are in English.
