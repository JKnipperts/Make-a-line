# Make a Line 
"Make a line" is a modernized remake of the classic puzzle game "Color Lines" which uses DirectDraw and A* pathfinding.
I wrote this game back in 2005 using  MS Visual C++ 6.0 and the DirectX SDK of June 2005. Therefore some modifications will be necessary to compile it under a modern environment. The original Visual Studio project files are included and could be helpful for the configuration.

## Gameplay:
Click on a ball to select it and then click on an empty square to move it there. You can only move along unblocked paths. Build rows of 5 or more balls of one color to score.

## Notes: 
- The game uses the A* Pathfinder (Version 1.71a) by Patrick Lester for pathfinding.
- The bin folder contains the complete game with all necessary files to play it.
- The game itself is in German but should be easily understandable and all comments in source code are in English.
