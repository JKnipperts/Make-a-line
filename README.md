# Make a Line - A Color Lines Clone/Remake
Back in 2005 I did my own version of the addictive puzzle game "Color Lines". Now I recovered this old source code and decided to release it here under MIT License. Maybe it is still of use for someone.

When I wrote this game back in the day I used MS Visual C++ 6.0 and the DirectX 6 SDK and never updated the source code afterwards. Therefore some modifications will be necessary to compile it under a modern environment. The original Visual Studio project files are included.

## Notes: 
For pathfinding the game uses the A* Pathfinder (Version 1.71a) by Patrick Lester.
The bin folder contains the complete game with all necessary files to play it.
Ingame texts are in German but the gameplay should be easily understandable and all comments in the source code are in English.
