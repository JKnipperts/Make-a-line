# Make a Line - A Color Lines Clone/Remake
Back in 2005 I did my own version of the addictive puzzle game "Color Lines". Now I recovered this old source code and decided to release it here under MIT License. Maybe it is still of use for someone.

When I wrote this game I used MS Visual C++ 6.0 and the DirectX 6 SDK and I never updated the source code in any form. Therefore some modifications will be necessary to compile it under a modern environment. The original Visual Studio project files are included.

All code is done by me except the pathfinding. For this purpose the game uses the A* Pathfinder (Version 1.71a) by Patrick Lester.

Note: Texts in actual game are in German but gameplay should be easily understandable. Further all comments in the source code are in English.
The bin folder contains the complete game with all necessary files and not just the binary.
