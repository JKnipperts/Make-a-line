# Make a Line - A Color Lines Clone/Remake
In 2005 I wrote my own version of "Color Lines", an addictive puzzle game originally published in 1992 for MS DOS.

I decided to release this old source code here under MIT License. Maybe it is still of use for someone.
When I wrote this game in 2005 I used  MS Visual C++ 6.0 and the DirectX 6 SDK and never updated the source code afterwards. Therefore some modifications will be necessary to compile it under a modern environment. My original Visual Studio project files are included.

## Notes: 
- The game uses the A* Pathfinder (Version 1.71a) by Patrick Lester for pathfinding.
- The bin folder contains the complete game with all necessary files to play it.
- All ingame texts are in German but the gameplay should be easily understandable and the source code is commented are in English.
